**Influence of sediment dynamics and alluvial fan formation on paleoseismic studies in southern California, North America–status: ongoing (2020–2021)** 
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, Open Sans; font-size:12.5pt">
In this study, we collected 16 luminescence samples from the same four sets of alluvial fans at the Mission Creek that have already been independently dated using $^{10}$Be (boulders/depth profiles), optically stimulated luminescence, and p-IR IRSL. Preliminary findings suggest possible grain reworking and mixing near the fan surfaces (~1-m) in this semi-arid environment. We also found a reasonably good correspondence between the upstream and downstream depositional events at the Mission Creek catchment based on overlapped p-IR IRSL subpopulation ages in multiple samples.

***Figure*** *showing the probability density plots of the luminescence single-grain subpopulation ages from 11 samples and 41 published $^{10}$Be ages in a log scale. The top x-axis is showing ages in thousand years. For all the samples, p-IR IRSL subpopulation ages with more than 17 to 76% of grains, that is the higher proportion of grains, correspond well with the youngest cluster of $^{10}$Be ages.*

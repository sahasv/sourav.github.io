*I am also highly passionate about teaching geology, especially in the field. I am committed to implementing (pedagogically sound) active learning strategies in the classrooms that intentionally and actively foster equality and inclusiveness. My expertise as a field geologist and skills in operating inexpensive but innovative technologies, both in the field and inside the classroom, help me become a dynamic teacher. Through my teaching and research, I strive to ensure that my students perform at their fullest potential and flourish in the competitive professional world, irrespective of their backgrounds and affiliations. A statement on my teaching philosophy can be found [here](files/Saha_Teaching_Philosophy_2021.pdf).*

**Diversity & Inclusion**
</p>

<p style="font-family: times, Open Sans; font-size:12.5pt">
My efforts in fostering diversity and inclusion can be summarized based on my experience in engaging students in classrooms, my teaching and research plans related to equity and inclusivity, and my own experience and values related to diversity. I am committed to cultivate an equitable academic climate where my students feel comfortable and a sense of belongingness. I am also a first-generation minority college student, which gives me confidence and helps shape my views as an instructor. With my experience, background, involvements, and aspirations, I plan to make *inclusive excellence* an essential part of my curriculum. A brief diversity and inclusion statement is provided [here](files/Saha_Diversity_Statement_2021.pdf).

**Preparing Future Faculty Program**
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, Open Sans; font-size:12.5pt">
I completed a certificate course on *Preparing Future Faculty* (PFF) at the University of Cincinnati. The PFF program intends to hone teaching skills, improve pedagogy, and incorporate innovative teaching methods in the classroom. Under this program, I taught traditional and non-traditional students, learned different active learning strategies (e.g., blended learning, flipped classrooms), and attended >10 workshops and conferences on pedagogy and science teaching on and off the campus. I also visited local Liberal Arts Colleges in Cincinnati to understand their teaching focus and styles, and I observed classes of other faculties both at the University of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky University. I occasionally attend PFF reading groups and participate in discussions. Details about the certificate program can be found [here](https://grad.uc.edu/development/pff.html).

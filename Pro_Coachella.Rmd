**Constraining a long history of paleolake and paleoseismicity at Coachella, CA, using deep borehole samples–status: ongoing (2020–2022)** 
</p>
<p style="font-family: times, Open Sans; font-size:12.5pt">
This study provides context for the long-term relationship (up to ~7 ka or more) between the lake loading of the ancient Lake Cahuilla and paleoearthquakes on the southernmost ~100 km of the San Andreas Fault. We drilled and extracted a ~33.5-m long borehole from the NE shorelines of the ancient lake Cahuilla near Coachella, CA. We are currently dating the lake and subaerial stratigraphic units from the borehole using single-grain IRSL and $^{14}$C. We recently submitted another proposal to SCEC to extract another borehole from the deep lakebed.

***Figure.*** *Coachella (shoreline) core stratigraphic log (CSD-01) showing the alternative subaerial (sandy/silty) and lacustrine (clayey/silty) units. As many as 20 lacustrine units are identified of the ~33.5-m core. Thirteen luminescence samples (brown circles) are dated, and 30 $^{14}$C samples (yellow circles) are collected to constrain the lake Cahuilla's long-term lake filling and desiccation cycles. Published $^{14}$C and uncorrected luminesce ages are provided for reference. The upper ~6-m of the log was adapted from Philibosian et al. (2011). Preliminary findings are made available in [SCEC interim report](https://files.scec.org/s3fs-public/reports/2020/20144_report.pdf?LhcDsJMZaU__5B8Q9mXdu6MjIQaBr5sI).*
